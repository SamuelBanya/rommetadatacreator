** Project A (Python): ROM Metadata Creator
**** Overall Project Goals
1. Scan a small set of NES/SNES/Gameboy ROMs
2. Generate JSON + CSV with file names, hashes, and sizes
*** Week 1
**** Goals
1. Research file related & hash file Python modules
- Use this Python module to obtain information about the current filepath
- Pathlib:
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.WindowsPath
- Use this Python module for determining a file hash:
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html

2. Outline parsing strategy:
- This will involve basic file parsing techniques in Python which are pretty simple in comparison
- This is so we can determine the file name, hash, and file size
- The file name and file size is easy, and most likely from the 'OS' related Python libraries
- However, the hash itself is something completely new to me, so this will require a bit of research to generate.
*** Week 2–3
**** Goals
1. Add a simple wizard that asks the user a few things, and saves the config settings to a file that is dumped to the same directory that the Python script is run in
2. Implement folder scanning + JSON/CSV output

Wizard Questions For User:
- 1. Ask For OS (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- 2. Ask user what specific console they are trying to use so we know what types of files to scan (1: NES, 2: SNES, 3: Gameboy)
- 3. Depending on what the user said for #2, add user prompts to ask for specific folder directories since that is crucial, and very specific to each user's ROM directory setups

<2025-12-15 Mon 13:42>: NOTE: This was the command I used to create the Python virtual environment for reference (aka .venv):
#+begin_src bash
  sam@Tinas-MacBook-Air ~/hub/rommetadatacreator (main) $ python3 -m venv .venv
#+end_src


*** Week 4
**** Goals
- Package as CLI tool
- Add sample dataset + README
